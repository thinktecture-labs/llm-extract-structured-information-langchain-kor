Create a single, self-contained, HTML file (do not use any javascript frameworks). CSS and Javascript should be embedded into the HTML file!

The page must have the following content and functionality.

A form with a single textbox (query). The value of the textbox must be HTTP POST to an API (http://localhost:8000/filter). Use Fetch API for that.

Sample request payload:

```json
{
    "query": "HERE COMES THE QUERY"
}
```

The API will return a with a JSON. Sample response:

```json
{
  "departure_airport": "Frankfurt",
  "destination_airport": "London",
  "departure_date": "2023-06-30",
  "return_date": "2023-07-02",
  "airline": [
    "Lufthansa",
    "Condor"
  ],
  "class": "premiumeconomy",
  "number_of_persons": 2
}
```

A second, readonly, form should be created, which has the following fields:

- departure_airport
- destination_airport
- departure_date
- return_date
- airline
- class
- number_of_persons

The second form should be filled the values from the API response.

No validation is required!

For styling, please use Bootstrap (which can be loaded from a CDN) with the default theme.
